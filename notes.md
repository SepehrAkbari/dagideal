### The Rank-3 Flattening Barrier and Strassen's Equations

**The Mathematical Hurdle:** For a tensor $T \in \mathbb{C}^3 \otimes \mathbb{C}^3 \otimes \mathbb{C}^3$, the principal flattenings are matrices of size $3 \times 9$. The standard method for finding defining equations of the secant variety $\sigma_r$ is to compute the $(r+1) \times (r+1)$ minors of these flattenings.
When $r=1$ or $r=2$, this requires computing $2 \times 2$ or $3 \times 3$ minors, which perfectly bounds the variety. However, for $r=3$, the shortcut requires $4 \times 4$ minors. Because the flattenings only have 3 rows, all $4 \times 4$ minors are trivially undefined or zero. The flattening matrices are structurally full rank, meaning they provide no algebraic invariants for $\sigma_3$.

**The Solution (Strassen's Equations):** To computationally bound $\sigma_3(\mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^2)$, we must step beyond 2D flattenings. As proved by Strassen (1983), the defining ideal is generated by degree-4 polynomials. These are obtained by viewing the tensor as three $3 \times 3$ matrix slices, $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$. The Strassen polynomials are the 9 entries of the matrix defined by the commutator-like expression:

$$S(X) = X_0 \cdot \mathrm{adj}(X_1) \cdot X_2 - X_2 \cdot \mathrm{adj}(X_1) \cdot X_0$$

where $\mathrm{adj}(X_1)$ is the classical adjugate matrix. By injecting these specific degree-4 polynomials into the ideal before elimination, we can bypass the Gröbner basis bottleneck for rank-3 constraints.
